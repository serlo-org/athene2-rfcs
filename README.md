# Athene2 Request for Comments

This GitHub repository handles the process for new development projects (modelled as GitHub issues in this repository). Everyone (with a GitHub account) can view and participate in the discussion on [existing proposed development projects](https://github.com/serlo-org/athene2-rfcs/issues) or [create a new proposal](https://github.com/serlo-org/athene2-rfcs/issues/new).

We classify the issues in different stages representing the flow from a rough idea to a Serlo project. You can view a Kanban board with the current stages in our [organization-wide Product Management project](https://github.com/orgs/serlo-org/projects/3).

## Stage 0: Strawman

**Purpose**: allow open discussion for new proposals; give space to raise concerns and address those

Anyone can start the discussion for a development project by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/serlo-org/athene2-rfcs/issues/new). We only require the proposed development project to be *big enough* (e.g. small feature requests should instead be proposed in the respective projects itself, like [Athene2](github.com/serlo-org/athene2)) and to not go into *too much implementation details* (as long as those aren't needed for a decision). Other than that, there are no formal requirements and we explicitly welcome both user-centered as well as technical-centered proposals. Furthermore, everyone is invited to participate in the discussion and raise/address concerns. One may also [react to proposals](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/).

## Stage 1: Draft

**Purpose**: non-vetoed proposals

To advance to Stage 1, proposals should have been accepted (i.e. not vetoed) in a appropriate "open" meeting (e.g. workshops organized by the Product Management unit, Lama meeting) and addressed raised concerns.

## Stage 2: Project

**Purpose**: initiated Serlo project

To advance to Stage 2, proposals should have a project overview so that they can be presented in a Lama meeting (and Serlo convent if needed). From this stage on, a proposal becomes a "normal" Serlo project and follows those processes.
